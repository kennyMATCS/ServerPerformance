# ServerPerformance
Server Performance is a Spigot plugin that displays what actions are taking up the most server performance. 
This is done through Spigot's built-in Timings System. Server Performance simply takes the Timings data, and outputs it in an easy to read percentage list. <br>
To view Server Performance data, simply run the command `/performance`.

## Permissions
`serverperformance.use` Allows you to use the `/performance` command.
